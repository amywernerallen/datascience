## Data Science
### Welcome to Amy's Data Science Repository!

Assembled here are examples of some data science projects that I have done over the years, including code (mostly in R), graphics, markdown files, and documentation. Most of the work stems from the [DS Certificate program](https://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/data-science) I am taking at UW.

1) College Scorecard Project: this is an exploratory data analysis based off of college scorecard data <br>
2) Data Science R Scripts: a collection of R scripts from my data science course at UW <br>
